# Robot-Wars
Robot Wars was designed to be a fun robot combat simulation. While working on this project, my goal was to adhere to software engineering principles, providing a clean, maintainable, and extensible code structure. As a result, you can add as many robots to the tournament as you wish without changing the code, as they are independent of the classes.

Thank you for reviewing my project! :^)
